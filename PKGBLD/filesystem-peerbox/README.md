## filesystem-nuberrypi


This package defines file located in /etc directory. 
Package is edited upstream ArchLinux Arm filesystem package, it will always keep up with upstream to keep compatibility 
but it will include changes needed for NuBerryPi.
It is responsible for "hostname", users, groups, fstab, motd greeter and so on.
Also, it defines "host.deny" and "hosts.allow" files which act as a firewall enabling ssh connections only on local network.

### /etc/fstab

This file defines partitions to be used by NuBerryPi.

* /var/lib/nud partition is placed on f2fs fileystem, the flash friendly filesystem by Samsung optimized for flash memory like SD cards.

* /var/log is placed in tmpfs, a RAM based filesystem

* /tmp is also placed in tmpfs

This changes will enable SD cards to live longer, by saving writes or optimizing them (f2fs).
Moving /var/log and /tmp in RAM is security feature too, when you shut down NuBerryPi all the logs go to oblivion.
