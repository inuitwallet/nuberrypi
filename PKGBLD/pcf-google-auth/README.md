# Use google-authenticator for 2-factor-authentication for NuBerryPi

[Google-authenticator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator) is most popular 2FA implementation in existance, used by many online services. 
You might know it from crypto-currency exchanges where it is de-facto standard security feature.

Now you can use it to add extra security to your NuBerryPi installation.

To install it, use following command:

> sudo pacman -S pcf-modules-gauth

Now system is configured to use google-authenticator but you still need to configure it per user.

> google-authenticator 

this is a script to help you trough this process.
It is quite simple, you must read carefully though and answer with y (yes) or n (no).

In order of appearance right answers are y, y, y, n, n.
(This will be automated in the future.)

After first y script will output some numbers so take a look.
Secret key is what you will enter into Desktop google-authenticator client or for any client that does not support scanning qrcode.

However you will most likely want to use this on your mobile device so just click on link above those codes, which will display qrcode and you can scan it with your mobile device and it will autoconfigure itself.

That is it, google-authenticator is now configured.

Now try to log into your NuBerryPi via SSH.
As usual you will be prompted for your user password, but after it you will be prompted for your authentication code.
